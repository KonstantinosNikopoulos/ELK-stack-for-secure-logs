# ELK-stack-for-secure-logs
ELK elastic stack project for secure log files    

ELK stack from https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack               
"ELK" is the acronym for three open source projects: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine. Logstash is a serverâ€‘side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a "stash" like Elasticsearch. Kibana lets users visualize data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch. 


This repo contains configuration files for filebeat, logstash, elasticsearch.

### Pass them to filebeat =>       
### Pass output to logstash =>
